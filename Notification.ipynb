If both fail, keep dividing one half until you either run out of content or the problem goes away, and then identify the culprit pattern.</p>\n",

Assuming that works, add your content in one chunk at a time until it breaks, and then identify the culprit.  If it doesn't work, try copying a known-good sitemap file from somewhere (e.g. <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/sitemap%5Findex.xml\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.google.com/hostednews/sitemap_index.xml</a>), stipping out the content, and inserting your own. </p>\n",
